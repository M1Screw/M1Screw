I don't have a public social media account nor do I have any public job profile, all my FOSS work is done via this Github account.

### Current Projects

[SSPanel-UIM](https://github.com/SSPanel-UIM/SSPanel-UIM-Dev)

SSPanel-UIM is my learning project for PHP, refactored most of its major systems including WebAPI, subscribe, billing, caching, and cron, and introduced a custom config system for the different node type/transport/params configuration mixes.

[UIM-Server](https://github.com/SSPanel-UIM/UIM-Server)

UIM-Server is my learning project for Go, currently, it is just a simple fork, but I plan to refactor its API sub-system and add support for the new SSPanel-UIM node API at a later date.

[Chevereto-Telegram-Bot](https://github.com/M1Screw/Chevereto-Telegram-Bot)

Chevereto-Telegram-Bot is my learning project for Python, originally written with Python 2.7, which now has been patched to be run on the latest Python 3.11 runtime. It currently only supports uploading images as an anonymous user due to Chevereto's API limitation, but after its per-user API system is released, I plan to refactor this simple bot to a more feature-rich & easier-to-use state.

### Planned Projects

These projects are all WiP with no ETA, all my projects unless specifically stated are all licensed under GPL-3.0 license.

[Backup-Manager](https://github.com/M1Screw/Backup-Manager)

Backup Manager is a Golang-based backup solution for simple website/database backup and restore operations. I plan to use this as the replacement for the current bash script-based backup solution.

[Runtime-Guard](https://github.com/M1Screw/Runtime-Guard)

Runtime Guard is a Golang-based application that uses SHA3 hashing to generate file integrity reports and can be used to verify the application runtime environment in the event of server hardware breach/unauthorized access/0 day vulnerability etc. It can also be used to detect file corruption during deployment and avoid system downtime and loss of data.
