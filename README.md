### Current Projects

[SSPanel-UIM](https://github.com/SSPanel-UIM/SSPanel-UIM-Dev)

SSPanel-UIM is my learning project for PHP, refactored most of its major systems including WebAPI, subscribe, billing, caching and cron, and introduced a custom config system for the different node type/transport/params configuration mixes.

[UIM-Server](https://github.com/SSPanel-UIM/UIM-Server)

UIM-Server is my learning project for Go, currently, it is just a simple fork, but I plan to refactor its API sub-system and add support for the new SSPanel-UIM node API at a later date.

### Planned Projects

Backup-Manager

Backup Manager is a Golang-based backup solution for simple website/database backup and restore operations. It features compression, encryption, file integrity verification, and cloud synchronization for the backup data. It provides a web web-based GUI to manage backup tasks.

Runtime-Guard

Runtime Guard is a Golang-based application used to generate hash-based file integrity reports and can be used to verify the application runtime environment in the event of server hardware breach/unauthorized access/0 day vulnerability etc. It can also be used to detect file corruption and avoid operational data loss.
